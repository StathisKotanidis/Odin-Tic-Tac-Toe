# Tic-Tac-Toe  - The Odin Project

## Project Overview
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is part of The Odin Project's curriculum, aimed at teaching core web development skills through practical projects.

## What I Learned

1. HTML Structure and DOM Manipulation
 - Creating Dynamic Content: I learned how to dynamically generate and manipulate HTML elements using JavaScript, such as creating the game board and updating player scores.
 - Event Handling: I gained experience in adding and removing event listeners to interact with the game board, allowing for responsive gameplay.

2. JavaScript Fundamentals
 - Object-Oriented Programming: I used JavaScript objects to represent players, which allowed me to encapsulate player-related data and behavior (e.g., name, marker).
 - Control Flow and Logic: I implemented game logic, including checking win conditions, detecting draws, and switching turns between players.
 - State Management: I learned how to manage game state, including resetting the board and correctly reinitializing the game after a win or draw.

3. CSS Styling and Layout
 - Responsive Design: I practiced creating a responsive and visually appealing layout using CSS Grid to structure the game board and other UI elements.
 - User Feedback: I learned how to provide visual feedback through CSS, such as disabling the game board after a win and displaying messages for win/draw conditions.

4.  Debugging and Problem Solving
 - Identifying and Fixing Bugs: I improved my debugging skills by identifying issues with event listeners, state management, and game logic, and implementing solutions to ensure smooth gameplay.
 - Iterative Development: I experienced the importance of iterative development, where I continuously tested, debugged, and refined the game to achieve the desired functionality.

5.  Project Management
  - Organizing Code: I learned how to break down the project into manageable functions and methods, making the code more modular, readable, and easier to maintain.
  - Documentation: Through this README, I practiced summarizing the project's goals and outcomes, helping to document the learning process.

## Technologies Used
- HTML: Structure and layout of the game.
- CSS: Styling and responsive design.
- JavaScript: Game logic, DOM manipulation, and event handling.

## Conclusion 

This project reinforced my understanding of fundamental web development concepts and provided hands-on experience in building an interactive application. The skills learned here will be invaluable as I continue through The Odin Project and take on more complex challenges.
