# Tic-Tac-Toe  - The Odin Project

## Project Overview
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is part of The Odin Project's curriculum, aimed at teaching core web development skills through practical projects.

## What I Learned

1. HTML Structure and DOM Manipulation
 - Creating Dynamic Content: I learned how to dynamically generate and manipulate HTML elements using JavaScript, such as creating the game board and updating player scores.
 - Event Handling: I gained experience in adding and removing event listeners to interact with the game board, allowing for responsive gameplay.
